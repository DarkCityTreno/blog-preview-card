## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge was in many ways very similar to the first one which is in my opinion actually a good thing, but I learned box-shadow property, and pseudo-classes visited, hover, focus, active.

## Acknowledgments

Didn't forget I can just do `css .main {padding: 5%;}` instead of `css .main{padding: 5% 5%;}`, as was noted by @DylandeBruijn in my first challenge :D
